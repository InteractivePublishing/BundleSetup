HELP suppliment tractography. For best viewing on windows, open with wordpad.
Tractography is not fully integrated.

NOTE: Tractography only avalable for some data bundles.

Tractography display and differentation is difficult.
When enabling a new streamline set, we recommend disabling the previous one first.
Tractography requires SlicerDMRI extension.

Loading a tractography scene is another condition which can reset the mouse
interactor to manipulation only mode instad of contrast/brightness.
The mouse interaction toolbar (from the view menu) needs to be enabled to switch
it back.

3D display doesnt show labels. Advanced users may examine the documentation of
the segmentations module to see how to view labels in 3D
