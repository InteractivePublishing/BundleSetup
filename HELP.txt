(Not all modules available, the extension manager can add additional)

HINT: Hold the shift key on your keyboard and experiment with your mouse.

Advanced users can access the full 3D Slicer functionality by right clicking
on the main toolbar, and enabling the parts you're looking for.

Limitations and Known issues:
First load of data is slow, windows may offer to close the program for you.

Slicer convention places object left on image right.

Enabling/Disabling all labels is slow.

NOTE: Tractography only avalable for some data bundles.
Look for tractography.mrml in the component data bundles.
Tractography display and differentation is difficult.
When enabling a new streamline set, we recommend disabling the previous one first.
If you forget, you will have to click a second time on the new streamline set,
and the previous one will still be marked as visible.

Installation:
If the setup scripts fail they're relatively simple, you can use the slicer
documentation to find out how to add the important slicer start option
--python-script "bundlePath/ndLibrarySupport/Testing/DistStart.py"
Replace bundlepath with the full path to the bundle folder.
