(Not all modules available.)

HINT: Hold the shift key on your keyboard and experiment with your mouse.

Advanced users can access the full 3D Slicer functionality by right clicking
on the main toolbar, and enabling the parts you're looking for.

To access the 3D Slicer settings, in three steps.
One: open python terminal using key combo shortcut "ctrl+3"
Two: copy/paste the following into the open pyton console, and press enter to
open settings dialog.
slicer.app.settingsDialog().show();
Three: close python terminal using key combo shortcut "ctrl+3"

Limitations and Known issues:
First load of data is slow, windows may offer to close the program for you.

Slicer convention places object left on image right.

The in "Registration" protocol "UserData" view does not change angle with the
slider. The expectation is you want to hold it's orientation constant. For
data in good alignment (especially examples) this can be confusing.

Enabling labels+models by clicking is somewhat slow.

Tractography display and differentation is difficult.
When enabling a new streamline set, be sure to disable the previous one first.
If you forget, you will have to click a second time on the new streamline set,
and the previous one will still be marked as visible.

3D protocol does not fully initialize when first loaded.
The work around is to load 3D, switch to Registration, and then back to 3D.


Installation:
If you should accdentially abort the installation,
Assuming you have no other data+viewer bundless installed you should clear the
whole installation, settings and broken temp files.
1) Delete the whole BaseInstallPath, the default is:  c:\IP\
2) Delete the settings folder:  C:\ProgramData\CIVM
If you're having trouble finding this folder, you can use open your
ProgramData folder with gui folder explorer and delete CIVM folder as follows:
Open a cmd prompt terminal,
type  "explorer %ProgramData%"  and press enter.
(omit the quotes)

3) Delete the individual settings from %AppData%
Open a cmd prompt terminal,
type  "dir %AppData%\CIVM"  and press enter.
(omit the quotes)
(if result ends with "File Not Found" skip to 4)
Open your AppData folder with gui folder explorer and delete CIVM folder
>  explorer %AppData%

4) Validate temp settings are not found using
type  "dir %TEMP%\CIVM_AtlasViewer.ini"  and press enter.
(omit the quotes)
(expected result is a bunch of stuff ending with "File Not Found")
delete the file if its found, to use the gui you can open the %TEMP% folder with the cmd prompt like the others.


Settings Reset:
If you should select the permanent confirmation checkbox and wish to reset it,
follow installation help steps 2,3,4 as above.
Then run the appropriate bundle setup script.
